### Inspiration
Repo-Rater was inspired by the desire to create a tool that could help developers easily and quickly improve their code quality. Our team saw the potential in combining advanced AI technology with Github's API to provide users with a simple, yet effective solution for performing code analysis and making improvements. We believe that such a tool can help developers save time and effort and produce more efficient and effective code.

### What it does
Repo-Rater evaluates and analyzes the user's code using OpenAI to provide an overall rating of code quality, areas of improvement, and a refined version of the code with the suggestions implemented. Users enter a Github repository link and specific file path for analysis and the website provides feedback through a separate terminal to help make their code more efficient.

### How we built it
Repo-Rater was built using GitHub API to connect the repository with OpenAI API which is used to analyze and provide feedback. The project runs on Python and the APIs on the back end, and HTML, typescript, and react on the front end, with Flask connecting the two together.

--Note: Repo Rater is currently incomplete. We plan on finishing development in the future.
